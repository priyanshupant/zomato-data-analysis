# Zomato Bangalore Restaurants Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of Zomato Bangalore restaurants to gain insights into various aspects such as ratings, costs, locations, cuisines, and more. The analysis is performed using Python programming language, along with popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himanshupoddar/zomato-bangalore-restaurants). It contains information about various restaurants in Bangalore, including details like name, online ordering availability, book table options, ratings, votes, location, cuisines, approximate cost for two people, and restaurant type.

## Research Questions
The analysis aims to answer the following research questions:

1. What is the average rating of the restaurants and the average cost for two plates?
2. Which locations have the most and least number of restaurants?
3. How many restaurants have online order and book table facilities?
4. Does having an online-order facility or book-table facility affect the ratings?
5. What is the best place to open an online-service restaurant?
6. Which are the most common cuisines?
7. Which type of restaurants have the maximum ratings?
8. In what places are people more interested in voting?
9. Is there a relationship between the number of votes a restaurant receives and its rating?
10. Is there a relationship between the average cost for two and the votes/ratings a restaurant receives?

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several sections:

### 1. Data Preparation
   - Importing necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
   - Reading the dataset from the CSV file
   - Previewing the dataset and displaying its shape
   - Cleaning the data by dropping unwanted columns, handling missing values, and formatting data types

### 2. Data Exploration
   - Analyzing and exploring the dataset to answer research questions
   - Utilizing conditional statements, loops, and functions for data manipulation and analysis
   - Visualizing patterns, trends, and relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn
   - Performing numerical calculations using NumPy
   - Extracting insights and drawing conclusions from the analysis

## Results and Findings
The analysis provides insights into various aspects of Zomato restaurants in Bangalore, answering the research questions and visualizing patterns in the data.

## Future Improvements
This project can be extended by exploring additional aspects of the dataset, incorporating machine learning models for predictive analysis, or integrating external data sources for a more comprehensive analysis.
